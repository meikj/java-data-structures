This project implements a number of common data structures in Java. This is intended for educational purposes only, for
the purpose of revision and coding interview preparation.

The data structures (to be) implemented are:

* Doubly-linked list
* Binary tree (in progress)
* Trie (in progress)
* Array / vector (in progress)
* Hash table (in progress)

A Stack and Queue interface will be developed for the doubly-linked list, just to demonstrate that a doubly-linked list
can be used to implement these two data structures.

After this project is complete, the next step is to introduce algorithms which use these data structures.
